# Comparison-on-Three-Supervised-Learning-Algorithms-for-Breast-Cancer-Classification
Project CS649 Case Study

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of supervised machine learning models for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The study compares three algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF).
